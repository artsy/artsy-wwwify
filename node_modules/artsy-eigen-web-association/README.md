# artsy-eigen-web-association

This tiny app does nothing but serve the `apple-app-site-association` file,
needed for iOS Handoff/Universal Links/Shared Web Credentials to work, in the
required way.

## Serving config file

This app is meant to be used inside other apps. As such, the file serving is
mounted at `/`, which means that the apps using this app should mount it at
`/apple-app-site-association`.

Once mounted, you should be able to verify itâ€™s correctness [here](https://limitless-sierra-4673.herokuapp.com).

## Changing config file

When making changes, you should do so in the `apple-app-site-association.json`
file.
