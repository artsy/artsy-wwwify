  "readme": "# artsy-eigen-web-association\n\nThis tiny app does nothing but serve the `apple-app-site-association` file,\nneeded for iOS Handoff/Universal Links/Shared Web Credentials to work, in the\nrequired way.\n\nFor more information see:\n\n* [Handoff programming guide](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/Handoff/AdoptingHandoff/AdoptingHandoff.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014338-CH2-SW10)\n* [Universal Links programming guide](https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/General/Conceptual/AppSearch/UniversalLinks.html)\n* [Shared Web Credentials programming guide](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Security/Reference/SharedWebCredentialsRef/)\n\n## Serving config file\n\nThis app is meant to be used inside other apps. As such, the file serving is\nmounted at `/`, which means that the apps using this app should mount it at\n`/apple-app-site-association`.\n\n## Changing config file\n\nWhen making changes, you should do so in the `apple-app-site-association.json`\nfile.\n\nOnce finished with your changes, you’ll need to sign the file so that iOS 8\ncan confirm the validity of the configuration. Get the `artsy.net` SSL\ncertificate files from the 1password engineering vault and place them in a\ndirectory. Then create the signed file like so:\n\n    $ make CERT_DIR=\"/path/to/dir/with/certs\"\n\nBe sure to remember to delete the certificate files from your local file system\nonce done.\n",
